- Encouraged critical thinking and collaboration with peers to brainstorm and discuss potential solutions before testing any problem
- Discouraged reliance solely on trial and error in the Python interpreter, instead promoting a thoughtful approach to problem-solving.
- Highlighted the significance of understanding the underlying logic behind Python's behaviors to apply similar reasoning to different scenarios.

- Prepared me for Python-related interview scenarios and encouraged concious approach to quesions
